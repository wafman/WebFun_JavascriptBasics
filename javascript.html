                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular
                    for a varitety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for 
                    developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host enviroment 
                    (a web browser of Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to provide
                    programmatic control over them.

                    <li id="var_dec">
                        <a href="#var_dec">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript containers are variables for storing data values -
                        imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds the value. All 
                        Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. The unique names are called identifiers.<span>var x;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li id="var_as">
                        <a href="#var_as">Variable Assignments</a> Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables- our cup of coffee
                        can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value
                        to a variable. <span>var x = 10.</span> 
                    </li>
                    <li id="data_type">
                        <a href="#data_type">Data Type</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know
                        the data type. There are six data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean -<span>true</span> or <span>false</span>; null - <span>null</span> aka 
                        nothing; Numbers- <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String- <span>"Coding Dojo rocks!";</span> Array- <span>[1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and 
                        Object- <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name: 'Doc'}</span>
                    </li>
                    <li id="conditionals">
                        <a href="#conditionals">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions
                        - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. You can use conditionals
                        statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified 
                        condition is true, do this code in our block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first conditiona
                        is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
                    </li>
                    <li id="loops">
                        <a href="#loops">Loops</a>There are many different kind of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially
                        do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run
                        around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop! 
                    </li>
                    <li id="function">
                        <a href="#function">Function</a>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our fucntion, this will run 
                        that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk from
                        Ikea,  we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place
                        the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets
                        call our function over and over and over again.
